# Tribute-page-HTML-CSS
This is a Tribute page project made within FreeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design" course.

Because I tried playing with z-indexes and elements' positioning, I had troubles making the page responsive. 

In the end, I made it look alright on phone screens, however, the .title elements are distorted while resizing the page. Moreover, the same issue applies when the screen is bigger than the one it was initially written for. 

The code needs major improvements.
